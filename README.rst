.. _Rogue: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)

Install
-------

.. code-block::

    [sudo] pip install rogue_scores

The script as well as the Web server work with both Python 2.x and 3.x.

Upgrade with: ::

    [sudo] pip install -U rogue_scores

Usage
-----

`Read the docs`_.

This repository is Dokku-ready: you just need to set up persistent storage to
not lose scores between deployments and it should run without anymore
configuration.

If you just want the upload script, install the package and run it: ::

    rogue_scores

Itâ€™ll ask you which server to use the first time, and remember it.
