This release fixes a problem in the previous version where the limit of 20
scores has been removed.

v0.0.7 (31/05/2014)

``rogue_scores.web``'s functions, it's ok to upgrade.

- ``/scores`` now serves the JSON scores file, and ``/scores?pretty`` serves a
  pretty-printed version
- ``rogue_scores.web`` moved to ``rogue_scores.web.app``
- scores-related functions moved from ``web`` to ``web.store``, with ``Score``
  and ``ScoresStore`` classes
- scores are now internally stored as JSON objects instead of list
- the Web page now shows each score's level, status and cause.
